# Image-Processing- Undergraduate Research (August 2021- December 2022)
- Worked under Dr. Michael Goodisman, contributing to the understanding of social behavioral strategies in fire ants and supporting the lab's broader research objectives.
- Managed daily care and animal husbandry for fire ants, providing essential food and water to ensure optimal health and activity levels.
- Designed and implemented experimental setups to investigate ant rescue behavior, meticulously counting approximately 1,000 ants per setup. Integrated a nest box in each setup and strategically placed reproductive or worker larvae to observe rescue responses, utilizing overhead camera equipment to capture real-time data efficiently.
- Self-taught essential image-processing techniques using ImageJ to track individual ant movements to understand the rescue behaviour of fire ants in experimental video recordings.
- Gained initial experience in computational analysis, integrating it with biological research to enhance data interpretation and results accuracy.
